# Graphcut-Textures
Matlab implementation of Kwatra et al.'s paper *Graphcut Textures: Image and Video Synthesis Using Graph Cuts*. For computing graph cuts, I used the Matlab wrapper of Vladimir Kolmogorov's C++ graph cut library.

The code I wrote is "GraphCutTextures.m", "VideoGraphCutTextures.m", and "VideoGraphCutTexturesFountain.m" under the Bk_matlab folder.

See the folders "image_texture_results" and "video_results" for some results obtained with this code.
For convenience, I've also uploaded some video synthesis results to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0FOk__4FY_NASTu5TuKxyF_LGVOfMa9X
